Episode #5 - Migration.

When changing the models in the store/models.py, you need to push a migration into the database.

Use python manage.py makemigrations adds the changes to the database, but python manage.py migrate pushes it to the database.

You can then access the changes model fields as you would any other field: model_name.field_name.
